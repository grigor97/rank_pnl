Ranked-Based Causal Discovery for Post-Nonlinear Models

Official implementation of rank-based PNL causal discovery methods RankG and RankS




To run an example of RankG method, please run the following R script
```
Rscript run_RankG.R
```
which generates PNL model with sample size 100 and runs RankG method and outputs the estimated causal order. 




To run an example of RankS method please run the following R script
```
Rscript run_RankS.R
```
which generates PNL model with sample size 30 and runs RankG method and outputs the estimated causal order.
